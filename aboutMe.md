# ABOUT ME!

## Who am I? :eyes:

here's me with ben & jerry's

My name is Christelle Flores and I am a sophomore at Quinnipiac University majoring in
computer science with a minor in marketing.

### My Background :computer:

Prior to college, I've taken one computer science course in high school which influenced my
interest to pursue a career in the field *along with the appealing salary haha*. With the skills and
experience I gain from my studies, I hope to someday work as a web developer for some entertainment
or media industry.

### My Interests :clap:

When I'm not crying over comp sci assignments, I spend my free time hanging out with friends or binge
watching a show on Netflix *Shameless is pretty good, just saying*. I am also involved in a sorority
and dance team on campus.

### Fun Facts!

> My zodiac sign is Cancer.
> I'm a lefty :hand_left:
> My favorite color is blue/green (teal?).
> I think half-baked is the superior Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor.

### PETS :dog:

jk I don't have any pets, but here's me with my roommate and fellow comp sci student, madison.
