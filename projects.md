# PROJECTS

Below are some project I've worked on this semester:

## DMV Simulator

**GitHub Repo:**
[https://github.com/christelleflores/VendingMachine](https://github.com/christelleflores/VendingMachine)

This project created a basic simulation of a DMV. The program greets the user, assigns them a generated random number from 1 to 100, and calls out each number until the user's assigned number is called. A feature that was added to this program was creating a 1% chance of the user receiving a polite interaction is withe program. The other 99% will give the user a rude response.

**Created With:** Eclipse
**Language Used:** Java

**Thoughts:**
I thought this project was creative and simple. It gave me more experience working with git and dealing with merge conflicts. I personally liked implementing the rude response feature.
