# PROJECTS

Below are some project I've worked on this semester:

## DMV Simulator

**GitHub Repo:**
[https://github.com/christelleflores/VendingMachine](https://github.com/christelleflores/VendingMachine)

This project created a basic simulation of a DMV. The program greets the user, assigns them a generated random number from 1 to 100, and calls out each number until the user's assigned number is called. A feature that was added to this program was creating a 1% chance of the user receiving a polite interaction is withe program. The other 99% will give the user a rude response.

**Created With:** Eclipse
**Language Used:** Java

**Thoughts:**
I thought this project was creative and simple. It gave me more experience working with git and dealing with merge conflicts. I personally liked implementing the rude response feature.

## GPA Calculator

**GitHub Repo:**
[https://github.com/sahalk903/GPAQU](https://github.com/sahalk903/GPAQU)

This project created a simple program that calculates a user's GPA. It greets the user and asks them to enter their name, major, QU ID, courses, and grades received for those courses. The program uses a file writer which keeps track of the user's information along with the calculated gpa.
This project was worked on with two other students.

**Created With:** Eclipse
**Language Used:** Java

**Thoughts:**
I thought this project was good practice for using git and collaborating with other programmers. It also allowed me to practice and gain more experience with time management and teamwork. I thought the program itself was pretty easy, however there were a few struggles with figuring out correct code.
